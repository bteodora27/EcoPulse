# EcoPulse
EcoPulse is a community app that turns cleaning green areas into rewarding actions. Users upload before-and-after photos, AI verifies the cleanup, and eco-points are earned for each effort. Points can be used for discounts at local shops and restaurants — making cities cleaner and communities stronger.
